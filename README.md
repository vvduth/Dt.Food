 * When user tap on a restaurant, the app immediately show a address, phone number and some more images of that place.
## Tech Stack

## Availability
 * I made this App by React Native, run with Expo CLI modules and simulate it on my real device (Iphone 12).  :mobile_phone: 
 * This App can run on both IOS and Android system, but at the moment I do not have money to put it on the App Store or Google Play, so if you are an employer/ HR staff, please check a video demo below and hire me. :pleading_face:
